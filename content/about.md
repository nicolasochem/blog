title = "About Me"
+++

I'm a network engineer and software developer working for [Nuage
Networks](http://nuagenetworks.net/), in the San Francisco Bay Area. At work,
I'm mostly working with Python and TCL, but I prefer doing Rust on my free
time. I'm a native French speaker, but I'm fluent in English, and am learning
Arabic.

About my current setup:

- [Archlinux](https://www.archlinux.org/), but these days I've enjoyed working
  with [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/) and I've been willing to try
  out [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) for a while.
- [Gnome](https://www.gnome.org/)
- [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) (or Vim if I don't have a choice)
- Spaces, not tabs
- zsh (via the awesome [prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto))
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) instead of `grep`
- [exa](https://github.com/ogham/exa) instead of `ls`
